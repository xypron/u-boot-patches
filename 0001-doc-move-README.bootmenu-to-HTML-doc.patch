Subject: [PATCH 1/1] doc: move README.bootmenu to HTML doc

Convert README.bootmenu to reStructured text and move it to
usage/bootmenu.rst.

Adjust the text concerning configuration settings as these now are managed
via Kconfig.

-ANSI terminal bootmenu command
-
-The "bootmenu" command uses U-Boot menu interfaces and provides
-a simple mechanism for creating menus with different boot items.
-The cursor keys "Up" and "Down" are used for navigation through
-the items. Current active menu item is highlighted and can be
-selected using the "Enter" key. The selection of the highlighted
-menu entry invokes an U-Boot command (or a list of commands)
-associated with this menu entry.
-
-The "bootmenu" command interprets ANSI escape sequencies, so
-an ANSI terminal is required for proper menu rendering and item
-selection.
-
-The assembling of the menu is done via a set of environment variables
-"bootmenu_<num>" and "bootmenu_delay", i.e.:
-
-  bootmenu_delay=<delay>
-  bootmenu_<num>="<title>=<commands>"
-
-  <delay> is the autoboot delay in seconds, after which the first
-  menu entry will be selected automatically
-
-  <num> is the boot menu entry number, starting from zero
-
-  <title> is the text of the menu entry shown on the console
-  or on the boot screen
-
-  <commands> are commands which will be executed when a menu
-  entry is selected
-
-  (title and commands are separated by first appearance of '='
-   character in the environment variable)
-
-First (optional) argument of the "bootmenu" command is a delay specifier
-and it overrides the delay value defined by "bootmenu_delay" environment
-variable. If the environment variable "bootmenu_delay" is not set or if
-the argument of the "bootmenu" command is not specified, the default delay
-will be CONFIG_BOOTDELAY. If delay is 0, no menu entries will be shown on
-the console (or on the screen) and the command of the first menu entry will
-be called immediately. If delay is less then 0, bootmenu will be shown and
-autoboot will be disabled.
-
-Bootmenu always adds menu entry "U-Boot console" at the end of all menu
-entries specified by environment variables. When selecting this entry
-the bootmenu terminates and the usual U-Boot command prompt is presented
-to the user.
-
-Example environment:
-
-  setenv bootmenu_0 Boot 1. kernel=bootm 0x82000000  # Set first menu entry
-  setenv bootmenu_1 Boot 2. kernel=bootm 0x83000000  # Set second menu entry
-  setenv bootmenu_2 Reset board=reset                # Set third menu entry
-  setenv bootmenu_3 U-Boot boot order=boot           # Set fourth menu entry
-  bootmenu 20        # Run bootmenu with autoboot delay 20s
-
-
-The above example will be rendered as below
-(without decorating rectangle):

+bootmenu command
+================
+
+The "bootmenu" command uses U-Boot menu interfaces and provides
+a simple mechanism for creating menus with different boot items.
+The cursor keys "Up" and "Down" are used for navigation through
+the items. Current active menu item is highlighted and can be
+selected using the "Enter" key. The selection of the highlighted
+menu entry invokes an U-Boot command (or a list of commands)

+
+The "bootmenu" command interprets ANSI escape sequencies, so
+an ANSI terminal is required for proper menu rendering and item
+selection.
+
+The assembling of the menu is done via a set of environment variables
+"bootmenu_<num>" and "bootmenu_delay", i.e.::
+
+    bootmenu_delay=<delay>
+    bootmenu_<num>="<title>=<commands>"
+
+<delay>
+    is the autoboot delay in seconds, after which the first
+    menu entry will be selected automatically
+
+<num>
+    is the boot menu entry number, starting from zero
+
+<title>
+    is the text of the menu entry shown on the console
+    or on the boot screen
+
+<commands>
+    are commands which will be executed when a menu
+    entry is selected
+
+Title and commands are separated by the first appearance of a '='
+character in the value of the environment variable.
+
+The first (optional) argument of the "bootmenu" command is a delay specifier
+and it overrides the delay value defined by "bootmenu_delay" environment
+variable. If the environment variable "bootmenu_delay" is not set or if
+the argument of the "bootmenu" command is not specified, the default delay

+The above example will be rendered as below::

+    *** U-Boot Boot Menu ***
+
+       Boot 1. kernel
+       Boot 2. kernel
+       Reset board
+       U-Boot boot order
+       U-Boot console
+
+    Hit any key to stop autoboot: 20
+    Press UP/DOWN to move, ENTER to select
+
+The selected menu entry will be highlighted - it will have inverted
+background and text colors.
+
+The "bootmenu" cammand is enabled by::
+
+    CONFIG_CMD_BOOTMENU=y
+
+To run the bootmenu at startup add these additional settings::
+
+    CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_KEYED=y
+    CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=30
+    CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_MENU_SHOW=y
+
+When you intend to use the bootmenu on a color frame buffer console,
+make sure to additionally define::
