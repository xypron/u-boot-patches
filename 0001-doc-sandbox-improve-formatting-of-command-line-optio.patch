 Various options are available, mostly for test purposes. Use -h to see
 available options. Some of these are described below:

+-t, --terminal <arg>
+  The terminal is normally in what is called 'raw-with-sigs' mode. This means
   that you can use arrow keys for command editing and history, but if you
   press Ctrl-C, U-Boot will exit instead of handling this as a keypress.
   Other options are 'raw' (so Ctrl-C is handled within U-Boot) and 'cooked'
   (where the terminal is in cooked mode and cursor keys will not work, Ctrl-C
   will exit).

+  A device tree binary file can be provided with -d. If you edit the source

+  To execute commands directly, use the -c option. You can specify a single
   command, or multiple commands separated by a semicolon, as is normal in
   U-Boot. Be careful with quoting as the shell will normally process and
   swallow quotes. When -c is used, U-Boot exits after the command is complete,
   but you can force it to go to interactive mode instead with -i.
 
-* -i
-  - Go to interactive mode after executing the commands specified by -c.
